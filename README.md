# zipcode-npm-demo

This demo corresponds with [this Google slide deck][1]. This is part of a series of Friday morning talks that [Chatham Financial][2]'s technology team provides for [Zip Code Wilmington][3]. The demo simply illustrated how to set up a simple `package.json` file and use NPM's essential commands: `npm install` and `npm install --save`.

NPM scripts and using NPM as a frontend build tool were discussed, but not demonstrated.
